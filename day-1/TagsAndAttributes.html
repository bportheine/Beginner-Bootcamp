  <h1>Tags</h1>
  <p>
  Tags are used within all types of code languages, but in HTML they made using angle brackets"<>".
  Inbetween them is where you put an element, which specifies what the tag will serve as.
  These tags can serve as text, images, links and much more.
  Most tags need a matching closing tag which simply has a back slash preceding the word "</>".
