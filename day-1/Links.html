  <h1>Links</h1>
  <p>
  Links are made using the a tag, known as an anchor tag.
  By using an href attribute you can give a hyperlink a destination.
  You can use two different types of hyperlink paths, using a simple url, or a relative path.
  Using a relative path means that the link is to a path within the same file as the website.
  The navigation of this current website works using anchor tags with relative paths.
